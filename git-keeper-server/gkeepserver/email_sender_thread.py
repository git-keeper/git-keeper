"""
Provides a global interface for sending emails in a rate-limited fashion.

The email sender runs in a separate thread so that other threads do not need
to block when trying to send email due to rate limiting.

This module stores an EmailSenderThread instance in the module-level variable
named email_sender. Call start() on this instance to start the thread.

Example usage:

    from gkeepserver.server_configuration import config
    from gkeepserver.email_sender_thread import email_sender
    from gkeepserver.email import Email

    def main():
        config.parse()
        email_sender.start()

        email = Email('guy@domain.com', 'sup guy', 'Hi, guy!')
        email_sender.enqueue(email)

        email_sender.shutdown()
        email_sender.join()

    Provides a Thread which blocks waiting for new emails and sends them in a

    Usage:

    Call the inherited start() method to start the thread.

    Shutdown the thread by calling shutdown(). The sender will keep sending
    emails until the queue is empty, and then shut down. Call join() after
    shutdown() in the main thread to allow all the enqueued emails to be sent
    before proceeding.

    Add emails to the thread by calling enqueue(email). Emails must be
    gkeepserver.email.Email objects.
