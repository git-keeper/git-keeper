    The constructor takes in the information from the log and calls
    _parse_payload().

    It is the responsibility of classes which inherit from EventHandler to
    implement _parse_payload() and handle().

    Subclasses should also implement __repr__ for debugging.

    _parse_payload() should simply extract any needed information from the
    log data and store the information in private attributes. If there are
    any syntax errors in the log information it must raise a
    HandlerException. It should verify syntax but it should *not* check
    semantics.

    handle() should verify that the information is valid and then do what is
    necessary to handle the event.

    handle() will be called in the main thread, while _parse_payload will be
    called in the log event parsing thread.

    The event type is not a parameter for the constructor, because each event
    type has its own EventHandler subclass.
