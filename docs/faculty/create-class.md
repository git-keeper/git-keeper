To create a class you first need to create a CSV file with the names and email
addresses of the students in the class.

To create a class named `CS100`, create a file named `CS100.csv` containing
something like the following:

```
Hamilton,Margaret,mhamilton@example.edu
Hopper,Grace,ghopper@example.edu
Lovelace,Ada,alovelace@example.edu
```

Now you can add the class on the server using `gkeep`:

```
gkeep add CS110 CS110.csv
```

An Account will be created for any student in the class that does not already
have an account on the server. The account name will be the username portion of
the student's email address. Passwords are randomly generated. An email
containing the student's username and password will be sent to the student.
