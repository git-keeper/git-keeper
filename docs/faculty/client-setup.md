# Client Setup

This guide details how to setup a faculty machine to use the git-keeper
client. The client has been used successfully in OS X and Linux. It may work
in Windows using Cygwin or the Windows Subsystem for Linux but that has not been tested.

## Requirements

The client requires Git and Python3.

### OS X

If you run `git` in a terminal it will prompt you to install the Xcode tools
(which contain Git) if they are not already installed.

Download and install Python3.

The `cryptography` package is required to use SSH through Python. Once Python3
is installed, install the `cryptography` package using `pip3`:

```
pip3 install cryptography
```

### Linux

These dependencies should be straightforward to install on a Linux system
through your distribution's package manager.

## Installing the Client

To install the client system-wide, run the following command:

    sudo python3 -m pip install git-keeper-client

Alternatively, you may want to install the client in a Python virtual environment if you do not like to clutter your system's Python packages.

## Configuration

There must be a configuration file at `~/.config/git-keeper/client.cfg`.

`client.cfg` requires a section called `[server]` which defines the hostname of
the server, your faculty username on the server, and optionally the SSH
server's port number which defaults to 22.

There is also an optional section `[local]` in which you can define a directory
into which `gkeep` will fetch submissions.  If present, this *must* be an absolute path.

Here is an example `client.cfg`:

```
[server]
host = gitkeeper.myhostname.com
username = myfacultyusername
# optional
ssh_port = 22

# optional section
[local]
submissions_path = ~/submissions
```

## SSH Key

The client communicates with the server over SSH. You will need to copy your
SSH public key to the git-keeper server so that you can make SSH connections
without a password.

If you have never generated a public key, do so now:

```
ssh-keygen
```

All the defaults should be fine, you can press enter repeatedly to step through
the menus.

Now you need to copy your public key to your git-keeper server. If your faculty
username on the server is `<username>` and the hostname of your server is
`<hostname>`, run this:

```
ssh-copy-id <username>@<hostname>
```

## Usage

Now you should be able to run `gkeep` commands. Running `gkeep` without any
arguments will display a usage message.
