"""
Provides a globally accessible interface for interacting with a git-keeper
server through a paramiko SSH connection.

This module stores a SeverInterface instance in the module-level instance
variable named server_interface. Call connect() on this instance as early as
possible, probably in main() or whatever your entry point function is.
Attempting to call connect() a second time will raise a ServerInterfaceError
exception.

Any other modules that import the config will have access to the same instance
without having to call connect().

Before calling connect, be sure that you have called parse() on the global
ClientConfiguration object.

Example usage::

    import sys
    from gkeepclient.client_configuration import config
    from gkeepclient.server_interface import server_interface

    def main():
        try:
            config.parse()
            server_interface.connect()
        except ClientConfigurationError, ServerInterfaceError as e:
            sys.exit(e)

        # Now call methods such as server_interface.is_file(file_path)
