## git-keeper

Git-keeper is an automated code-testing tool where students obtain and submit assignments using Git.  Unlike other systems that require students to use a web portal or other external system, students interact with git-keeper using version control, and therefore are introduced to a skill that transfers to real-world projects.  When a student pushes their work to the server, git-keeper automatically tests the submission and sends the student an email containing the results.

Faculty interact with the system using a command-line tool to upload assignments to the server and to fetch student submissions for grading.  When assessing an assignment, git-keeper can utilize any language or tool that executes via the command line on a Linux system, making git-keeper adaptable to a wide range of classes and technologies.  In addition, git-keeper requires minimal dependencies and is easy to configure and administer on a local server.
