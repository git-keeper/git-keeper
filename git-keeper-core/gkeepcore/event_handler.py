    """Base class for objects which handle logged events.

    The constructor takes in the information from the log and calls _parse().

    It is the responsibility of classes which inherit from EventHandler to
    implement _parse() and handle().

    Subclasses should also implement __repr__ for debugging.

    _parse() should simply extract any needed information from the log data and
    store the information in private attributes. If there are any syntax errors
    in the log information it must raise a HandlerException. It should verify
    syntax but it should *not* check semantics.

    handle() should verify that the information is valid and then do what is
    necessary to handle the event.

    handle() will be called in the main thread, while _parse will be called in
    the log event parsing thread.

    The event type is not a parameter for the constructor, because each event
    type has its own EventHandler subclass.
